# dotfiles
Collection of hidden configuration files for, primarily, linux systems.

## Notes

### .vimrc 
* Most of .vimrc comes from various versions posted [here](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)
* Vundle is required in the ~/.vim/bundle/ directory
* I made manual changes to the LineNr highlight colors in the "atomified.vim" colorscheme
* The youcompleteme has extra installation steps (compiling YCM), see installation notes [here](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/youcompleteme#ubuntu-linux-x64)
